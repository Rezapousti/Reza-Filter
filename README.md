# Reza Filter 

**PyPI name:** `reza-filter`  
**Python import:** `import reza`

Reza Filter is a **zero-phase, frequency-domain** filter that shapes the spectrum using an exponential-window gain curve. It is designed for clean, practical band/low/high filtering in signals such as **EEG** and **IMU** time series, with optional **C++ (pybind11) acceleration** for the heavy parts.
